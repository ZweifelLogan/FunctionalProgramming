So far I have implemented all of the problems (2-6) for both their actual operations in Exercises.hs and the
    command-line/file reading and writing necessary in Main.hs
The only things I think I have left to do is implement some error handling mentioned in the assignment as well as
    sorting the list of outputs before writing to the file mentioned in problem 4
I don't expect to have a lot of difficulties completing the rest of the assignment as their is little left for me to 
    do unless I have overlooked or missed something big in the assignment description
